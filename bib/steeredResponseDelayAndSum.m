%steeredResponseDelayAndSum - calculate delay and sum in frequency domain
%
%Calculates the steered response from the delay-and-sum algorithm in the
%frequency domain based on sensor positions, input signal and scanning angles
%
%S = steeredResponseDelayAndSum(R, e, w)
%
%IN
%R - PxP correlation matrix / cross spectral matrix (CSM)
%e - MxNxP steering vector/matrix for a certain frequency
%w - 1xP vector of element weights
%
%OUT
%S - MxN matrix of delay-and-sum steered response power
