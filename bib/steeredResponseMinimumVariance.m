function S = steeredResponseMinimumVariance(R, e)
%steeredResponseMinimumVariance - minimum variance beamforming
%
%Calculates the steered response from the minimum variance beamforming algorithm in
%the frequency domain based on sensor positions, input signal and scanning angles
%
%S = steeredResponseMinimumVariance(R, e)
%
%IN
%R - PxP correlation matrix / cross spectral matrix (CSM)
%e - MxNxP steering vector/matrix for a certain frequency
%
%OUT
